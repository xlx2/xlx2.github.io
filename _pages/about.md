It is currently my second year of M.S. study in Communications at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. My major research interests are in the field of physical layer of wireless communications and deep learning. Specifially, I am working on the Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC), which aims to combine the sensing and communication capabilities on one single device. If you are interested in my research, please feel free to contact me. [My GitHub Pages](https://github.com/xlx2)
